    "  \n",
    "## About this Project\n",
    "In this project, you will explore an application of ML to a popular task in cybersecurity: malware classification.\n",
    "You will be presented with precomputed behaviour analysis reports of thousands of program binaries, many of which are malwares.\n",
    "Your goal will be train a malware detector using this behavioural reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Note on Grading\n",
    "The grading for this project will depend on:\n",
    " 1. Vectorizing Inputs\n",
    "   * Obtaining a reasonable vectorized representations of the input data (a file containing a sequence of system calls)\n",
    "   * Understanding the influence these representations have on your model\n",
    " 1. Classification Model  \n",
    "   * Following a clear ML pipeline\n",
    "   * Obtaining reasonable performances (>60\\%) on held-out test set\n",
    "   * Choice of evaluation metric\n",
    "   * Visualizing loss/accuracy curves\n",
    " 1. Analysis\n",
    "   * Which methods (input representations/ML models) work better than the rest and why?\n",
    "   * Which hyper-parameters and design-choices were important in each of your methods?\n",
    "   * Quantifying influence of these hyper-parameters on loss and/or validation accuracies\n",
    "   * Trade-offs between methods, hyper-parameters, design-choices\n",
    "   * Anything else you find interesting (this part is open-ended)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Details\n",
    " * 40 points: Vectorizing input data (each input = behaviour analysis file in our case)\n",
    " * 40 points: Training a classification model\n",
    " * 15 points: Analysis/Discussion\n",
    " * 5 points: Clean code\n",
    " \n",
    "## Filling-in the Notebook\n",
    "You'll be submitting this very notebook that is filled-in with your code and analysis. Make sure you submit one that has been previously executed in-order. (So that results/graphs are already visible upon opening it). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook you submit **should compile** (or should be self-contained and sufficiently commented). Check tutorial 1 on how to set up the Python3 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebook is your project report. So, to make the report readable, omit code for techniques/models/things that did not work. You can use final summary to provide report about these codes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely important that you **do not** re-order the existing sections. Apart from that, the code blocks that you need to fill-in are given by:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ------- Your Code -------\n",
    "#\n",
    "#\n",
    "```\n",
    "Feel free to break this into multiple-cells. It's even better if you interleave explanations and code-blocks so that the entire notebook forms a readable \"story\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code of Honor\n",
    "We encourage discussing ideas and concepts with other students to help you learn and better understand the course content. However, the work you submit and present **must be original** and demonstrate your effort in solving the presented problems. **We will not tolerate** blatantly using existing solutions (such as from the internet), improper collaboration (e.g., sharing code or experimental data between groups) and plagiarism. If the honor code is not met, no points will be awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Versions\n",
    "  * v1.1: Updated deadline\n",
    "  * v1.0: Initial notebook\n",
